#P6: Make Effective Data Visualization

## Summary 
The project have two graphs to illustrate the relation of Batting Average , Home Runs with Height and Batting Average , Home Runs with Weight . We can clearly See that the Height of the player have a great effect on the performance . Most of the Short Height Players tend to have a larger batting average and greater Home Runs , while the trend is clear for the Right Handed Batsman It also displays the same trend in the case of the Left and Both handed batsmans . In case of Both Handed Batsman players with Heigh 76 inchs have the best Batting Average and highest number of Home Runs 

## Design 

In this project to visualize the performance between different players first we selected The Batting Average and Home Runs as a metric for performance. Here I try to visualize the effect of Height and Weight of a player on the performance . So we assume Batting Average and Home Runs of a player as the dependent variable and Height and Weight as the independent variable . So we create two different visualization to find the effect of Height and Weight on Performance . We plot Height and Weight on X-Axis and Batting Average on Y-Axis. Now we need to visualize another metric for performance so here we use the bubble plot and denote Home Runs by the size of the Bubble , another important factor is the Handedness of the Batsman , Here we use differenet colors for different Handedness .

## Feedback

### Feedback 1:
The visualization don't have proper titles or axis and title for chart . Consider adding title and Legends for the chart .

### Feedback 2:
The visualization only show the realtion of Average and HomeRuns with Height consider adding another Chart to potray the same 
against Weight of a player.

### Feedback 3:
The visualization lacks information about the Handedness of a Batsman Consider adding the handedness to the chart.

### Post Feed Back Vizualization
